<a href='http://code.google.com/p/buddypress-media/'><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></a>

BuddyPress Media is a free, open-source WordPress plugin that adds "production grade" social media hosting capabilities to BuddyPress.

Able to scale to _millions_ of users with _hundreds of terabytes_ of content in a modern distributed hosting environment, the plugin has sophisticated memory and disk caches, can split users across multiple databases, and can offload bandwidth to content delivery networks like Amazon S3 and MaxCDN.

BuddyPress Media can exchange media items and data with other social networks, allowing your users "drag and drop" photos, audio, and videos between Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, or SoundCloud and their BP-Media albums. The plugin supports multiple user classes, and has eCommerce capabilities to help you monetize your website.

There's no catch, no trial period, no advertising, and no "pro version". Buddypress Media is <u>completely free</u>, and includes fully commented source code that we encourage you to use in your own plugins.

Currently serving <u>2.7 million users</u> on <u>16,000 different websites</u>, we're one of the most powerful, reliable, and best supported plugins ever created for BuddyPress. If you want to run a large media sharing community, <i>BuddyPress Media</i> is the place to start.
